# The approach is to use ground speed thresholds to define rapid movement
# then, use time of the year to define season of the migration
# if the time is unclear, add in direction

# This assumes an input of clean data split into a list of individuals

# required information
# high_d_thresh <- the number of meters required to define what is certainly migration
# low_d_thresh <- the number of meters required to define "not sedentary"
# g_thresh <- days between low_d_thresh days to define bursts of activity
# fall_months <- the months that are probably post-breeding season migrations (e.g. c(8:11))
# spring_months <- the months that are probably pre-breeding season migrations (e.g. c(1:6))
# distance_col <- the name of the column containing distance moved by the animal per day

# optional information
# visDODs is a data frame with individual ID and death date
# if use_ragged is true, days with speeds between low_d_thresh and high_d_thresh are kept
# if the bird died then (i.e. the reason the distance was not achieved is that the bird died)
# and if the bird also had traveled high_d_thresh in the preceding g_thresh days
# if use_ragged is false, low_d_thresh is used to define tracks but only high_d_thresh is maintained
